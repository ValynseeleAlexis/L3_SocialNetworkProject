This folder contains mini-project to learn web developpment in order to build the main project

I had no prior experience with django and only a little experience with web application as a whole
so I needed to work through several tutorial projects to learn how everything works . 

Special thanks to : Corey Schafer https://coreyms.com/ for his numerous tutorials on python and the django framework
