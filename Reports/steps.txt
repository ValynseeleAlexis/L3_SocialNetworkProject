First time working on the project 

- 1) Learning how to setup a virtual python env to setup the django project using virtualenv 

virtualenv : https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/
guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vscPTWKOk

to create the env
    virtualenv myenv_name

to use the env 
    source myenv_name/bin/activate

then we can install our packages :
    pip install package1,package2,package3 ....

To quickly setup the same env on an another machine we can export our requirements

pip frozen --local > requirements.txt

then on the other machine 

set up an env
then pip install -r requirements.txt



- 2) Setting up a django project :

With django installed
    django-admin startproject  myproject_name

then we can run the web server
    python myproject_name/manage.py runserver 

- 3) create an app :
        manage.py startapp appName

Then we can code our app in the app directory 
To add the app to the server path we need to include it in the root django project urls.py
for example 
urlpatterns = [
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]

or 

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),
] to make it the main app on the server (localhost:8000 redirect directly to 'myapp')


- 4) Using templates to generate html responses:
