!!!!steps.txt!!!
This file contains all the steps I went through to build this project with date stamp

First time working on the project 

- 1) Learning how to setup a virtual python env to setup the django project using virtualenv 

virtualenv : https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/
guide : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vscPTWKOk

to create the env
    virtualenv myenv_name

to use the env 
    source myenv_name/bin/activate

then we can install our packages :
    pip install package1,package2,package3 ....

To quickly setup the same env on an another machine we can export our requirements

pip frozen --local > requirements.txt

then on the other machine 

set up an env
then pip install -r requirements.txt



- 2) Setting up a django project :

With django installed
    django-admin startproject  myproject_name

then we can run the web server
    python myproject_name/manage.py runserver 

- 3) create an app :
        manage.py startapp appName

Then we can code our app in the app directory 
To add the app to the server path we need to include it in the root django project urls.py
for example 
urlpatterns = [
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]

or 

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),
] to make it the main app on the server (localhost:8000 redirect directly to 'myapp')

- 4) Using templates to generate html responses:

    First we make a templates directory and an app directory inside
    we can then add html.template that will be used by the server
    using the render method of django when creating views
    the context argument of the render method make it possible to pass python dictionaries that we can process in the html code with {{key}}
    , we can also make loop and conditional statements with {% python code %}

    we can use template inheritance to make a base template

- 5) Front-end : 
        -We can work on the base template to put a bit a of style to our website (navbar,css)

        !!!!For the learning project in Learning/django_01 I used the styling of Corey Schafer : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g on his django blog tutorial series
        !!! to follow the tutorial, i'll do my own front-end stuff when working on the real project

        to put css in a django project we need to create a static folder within the root directory of our app and a code block at the top of our html
        {% load static %}

        we can reference url with {% url 'url-name (setup within url.py)' % }
